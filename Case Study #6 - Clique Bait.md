# Case Study #6 - Clique Bait

## Introduction

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry! In this case study, you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyze his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

## Available Data

For this case study, there are five datasets that you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

### Users
- user_id
- cookie_id
- start_date
### Events
- visit_id
- cookie_id
- page_id
- event_type
- sequence_number
- event_time
### Event Identifier
- event_type
- event_name
### Campaign Identifier
- campaign_id
- products
- campaign_name
- start_date
- end_date

### Page Hierarchy
- page_id
- page_name
- product_category
- product_id

## 1. Digital Analysis

- How many users are there?

```sql
  SELECT count(distinct user_id) as users
   FROM [clique_bait].dbo.users ;
```
result: 500  users
-How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
  SELECT  AVG(users)avg_cookie_id
  FROM
  (SELECT distinct user_id, count(cookie_id) as users
   FROM [clique_bait].dbo.users
   GROUP BY user_id)AS counts;
```
result: the average of cookies is 3 
-What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
```sql
SELECT MONTH(TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME, LEFT(event_time, 19)))AS month_datetime, count(distinct visit_id)  number_of_visits
FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events
GROUP BY MONTH(TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME, LEFT(event_time, 19)))
ORDER BY MONTH(TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME, LEFT(event_time, 19)));
```
reuslt:
| Month     | Number of Visits |
|-----------|------------------|
| January   | 876              |
| February  | 1,488            |
| March     | 916              |
| April     | 248              |
| May       | 36               |
-What is the number of events for each event type?
```sql
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) n_event
   FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events
   GROUP BY event_type
    ORDER BY event_type;
```
result:
| Event Type    | Number of Events |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Page View) | 20,928            |
| 2 (Add to Cart)| 8,451            |
| 3 (Purchase)  | 1,777             |
| 4 (Ad Impression) | 876          |
| 5 (Ad Click)  | 702              |
-What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```sql
select ROUND(count(visit_id) /CONVERT(float, (select count(DISTINCT visit_id)  from [clique_bait].dbo.events) )*100,2) percentage_visits_purchase
from [clique_bait].dbo.events e
join [clique_bait].dbo.event_identifier i
on e.event_type = i.event_type
where i.event_name = 'Purchase';
```
result:
The percentage of visits that have a purchase event is approximately 49.86%.

-What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
```sql
SELECT ROUND(count(c.visit_id)/CONVERT(float, (select count(DISTINCT visit_id)  from [clique_bait].dbo.events) )*100,2)
FROM(
 SELECT visit_id, cookie_id, page_id, event_type
 FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events
 WHERE  page_id = 12) c
 left JOIN(
  SELECT visit_id, cookie_id, page_id, event_type
 FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events
 WHERE  event_type = 3) pu
 ON c.visit_id = pu.visit_id
 WHERE  pu.event_type is null
```
Approximately 9.15% of visits view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event.
-What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
```sql
SELECT  TOP 3 page_name, COUNT(*) number_views
FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events e
JOIN  [clique_bait].dbo.page_hierarchy p
ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE event_type = 1 
GROUP BY   page_name
ORDER BY number_views DESC;
```
The top 3 pages by the number of views are as follows:

1. "All Products" with 3,174 views
2. "Checkout" with 2,103 views
3. "Home Page" with 1,782 views
-What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
```sql
SELECT product_category, SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) number_views,  SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS number_cart_adds
FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events e
JOIN  [clique_bait].dbo.page_hierarchy p
ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY product_category;
```
Here are the counts of views and cart adds for each product category:

| Product Category | Number of Views | Number of Cart Adds |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Fish             | 4,633           | 2,789                |
| Luxury           | 3,032           | 1,870                |
| Shellfish        | 6,204           | 3,792                |
-What are the top 3 products by purchases?
```sql
SELECT product_category, COUNT(*) number_purchases 
FROM [clique_bait].dbo.events e
JOIN  [clique_bait].dbo.page_hierarchy p
ON e.page_id = p.page_id
where event_type IN( 3, 2) AND product_category IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY product_category desc;
```
The top 3 products by the number of purchases are as follows:

1. Shellfish with 3,792 purchases
2. Luxury with 1,870 purchases
3. Fish with 2,789 purchases
## Product Funnel Analysis
-Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

How many times was each product viewed?
How many times was each product added to cart?
How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
How many times was each product purchased?
```sql

## Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

-Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
```sql
   SELECT top 1 * FROM ProductMetrics
    order by number_views desc, number_cart_adds desc, number_purchased desc;
```
result:
| Product Name    | Number of Views | Number of Cart Adds | Number of Cart Abandoned | Number of Purchases |

-Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
```sql
 SELECT top 1 product_name, number_cart_abandoned  FROM ProductMetrics
 order by  number_cart_abandoned desc;
```
result:
| Product Name    | Number of Cart Abandoned |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Russian Caviar | 249                      |

-Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
```sql
    /*to measure the effectiveness of product pages or advertisements in converting potential customers (views) into actual buyers (purchases)

      into customers who make a purchase.*/
     SELECT  top 1  product_name, round(100* (number_purchased /convert(float,  number_views)),2) view_purchase_percentage FROM ProductMetrics

```
result:
| Product Name | View-to-Purchase Percentage |
|--------------|-----------------------------|

-What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
```sql

       to their shopping cart. This metric helps businesses understand how effectively

          a concrete step towards making a purchase.*/
